(5) Evaluate each state using the usual F = G + H (6) Use Manhattan distance for the heuristic function H() (7) Implement G() using the observation that the path finder prefers visiting states in the following order: forest: first choice, desert: second choice, hill: third choice, mountain: fourth choice, shallow ocean: fifth choice, deep ocean*: avoided at all costs. (*) a cell is considered a deep ocean cell if it is surrounded by at least 3 ocean cells in all directions (8) Allow diagonal moves" link="content/Images/path-finding.jpg" link_title="content/Images/path-finding.jpg" />

My task in this game was as a Lead Programmer, I built the AI for this game, the particle effect and programmed the audio within the game. </video>
<video file="content/Videos/Maxwells_Demon_Trailer_hi.flv" name="Maxwells_Demon" >Maxwells Demon: A 3D puzzle based game which utilizes NeuroSky BCI technology to allow users to actually move objects within the game with their minds. This game is still in BETA due to Blade 3D being a brand new engine and fact that BCI interface with gaming is something that has never been attempted thus far. I was the lone programmer in this project and had the task of integrating the NeuroSky device with the Blade3D Game Engine, the coding was mostly done in C# and integration with the Blade 3D game engine required Blade 3D specific syntax. 
I also created a random distraction generator with would cycle through 1 random distraction out of 5 per level and trigger when the attention level of the player was raised to a certain point.
For research purposes I was also give the task of programmatically generating an XML file which would hold specific player data during a specific time in order to document when a player was, what is attention level was, and which distract had occurred to trigger a distortion in the players Attention. This was done so that it could be charted in flash for ease of use.
